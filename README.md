# Countries-Population

This project aims to analyze and visualize the population data of countries worldwide by scraping data from *Wikipedia, cleaning and analyzing it in **MySQL, and then visualizing it using **Power BI*. The dataset includes population statistics for various countries for the years 2022 and 2023, with additional information on population growth, regions.

### Project Overview

1. Data Scraping:  
   The data is scraped from the [List of countries by population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population) Wikipedia page using *Jupyter Notebook* and Python libraries. The scraping process extracts relevant columns such as *Country, **Population 2022, **Population 2023, Change Percentage, **Region.

2. Data Cleaning and Analysis:  
   After scraping, the data is cleaned and processed in *MySQL*. The cleaning involves:
   - Removing irrelevant rows like non-country data.
   - Handling missing values and formatting inconsistencies.
   - Calculating growth percentages and ensuring data integrity.

3. Data Visualization:  
   The cleaned dataset is imported into Power BI, where I created interactive dashboards to visualize:
   - Population growth rates for countries between 2022 and 2023.
   - countries informaiton based on population change.

4. Tools & Technologies Used:  
   - Jupyter Notebook for data scraping with Python
   - *MySQL* for data cleaning and analysis
   - *Power BI* for data visualization

### Project Goals

- Demonstrate the process of extracting, cleaning, and analyzing real-world data.
- Create an interactive dashboard to showcase key insights like population growth trends.
- Present a visually appealing and informative analysis of global population data.

### Key Insights

- Identify countries with the highest and lowest population growth rates.
- Explore the impact of regional trends on population changes.
- Present findings in a way that can be easily understood by stakeholders through Power BI dashboards.

### Tools & Libraries

- *Python*: BeautifulSoup, pandas, requests (for web scraping)
- *MySQL*: Data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation
- *Power BI*: Data modeling, DAX, and interactive visualizations

### Future Work

- Improve the scraping script to handle more edge cases or source from additional countries.
- Integrate more detailed demographic data into the analysis, like age distribution or urban vs rural population.
